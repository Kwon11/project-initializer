Github auth is happening. Authentication happened.

Need to store the accesstoken and be able to retrieve it on requests.
  -Inital request to our server, before redirect to github, give browser cookie and create session with userID null
  -on final response from github, assign userID to session table, and assign token to users table
  -on subsequent requests that go to github, authenticate user with passport, look up their userID in our userTable and stick the accesstoken
    -pass that request to github with that information


GOAL: Push repo to users github
  -log in with github
  -scope: the permissions we get from the user regarding github
    -public_repo: read/write access to code

1) Register application
  -need name and URL, and redirect URL


HOW IT WORKS
1) User clicks sign in with github, client sends get request as follows

  GET https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
  params:
  {
    client_id: required, given by github for registered app, same for every user,
    redirect_uri: URL in stackBear app to redirect after login
    scope: public_repo, repo
    state: 'an unguessable random string used to protect against cross-site request forgery, (optional)
    allow_signup: not required, defaults to true. Allows brand new user to sign up for github
  }

2)   Redirected to our post-sign-in landing page
  {
    code: same temporary code from step 1
    state: 'unguessable string', if it doesn't match, its a third party attempt
  }
  -make sure state is correct

3) exchange the code for access token
  POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token

  {
    client_id:
    client_secret: required, given by github when registered
    code: response from step 1
    redirect_uri: same redirect URL from step 1
    state: unguessable string from step 1
  }
  default response: access_token=e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a&scope=user%2Cgist&token_type=bearer
  can be modified depending on access header

4) check response step 3 for the proper scopes and handle errors

5) Use the access token to access API
  GET https://api.github.com/user?access_token=...

A) where do I store the access token?
  The client  => server {accToken:} => github
B) User clicks "push to github"
  POST /api/push {accToken:} => server =>github

1. Passport githubStrategy for oAuth
  a) passport
  b) github strategy
  c) sessions, store the access token and use the right one
2. Create request to github api
